Description:

This video was created as a school project for a Computer Vision class. 
I apply several OpenCV filters to the video footage, showcasing the reusable Pangaea cups, that students of KU Leuven use to get free coffee or tea throughout the school year from Pangaea. 

The image processing operations used are the following:
- Grayscale an image
- Apply Gaussian blur with different Kernel sizes
- Apply Bilateral blur with different Kernel sizes
- Threshold Operation: grab an object in RBG colour space
- Threshold Operation: grab an object in HSV colour space
- Morphological Operations to improve grabbing: Dilation and Opening
- Sobel edge detection with various parameters
- Hough Circle Transform with various parameters
- Template Matching Operation
- Creating Bounding boxes and circles for contours
- Good Features to Track operation
- Apply a Cartoonizer filter
